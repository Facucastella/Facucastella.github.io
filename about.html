<p>I'm an industrial engineer based in Copenhagen with 1 year of experience. On September I am moving to Denmark to pursue a Business Analytics MSc. Engineering at Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU).</p>

<p>My purpose is to strengthen myself in the world of data analytics, in which I would like to develop myself in a team that seeks solutions to problems through the generation of information from data, producing high level insights in order to make the best decisions.</p>
